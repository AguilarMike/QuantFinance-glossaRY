TSpread <- TB10YS - TB3MS 
TSpread <- aggregate(TSpread,nfrequency=4,FUN=mean)# aggregate monthly data to quarterly(averages)

### VAR Model
library(vars)
VAR_Data<-na.omit(ts.union(GDPGrowth, TSpread)) #set up data for estimation
VARselect(VAR_Data, lag.max = 12, type = "const")$selection #obtain the best lag period
VAR_fit<-VAR(y = VAR_Data, p = 2)
summary(VAR_fit)

### IRF
# Consider the response of GDP growth to term spread shock
IRF_GDP<- irf(VAR_fit, impulse = "TSpread", response = "GDPGrowth", n.ahead = 20, boot = TRUE)
plot(IRF_GDP, ylab = "GDP growth", main = "Shock from Term spread")
#Interpret: The IRF estimates the effects from one unit shock to the error in the TSpread on future value of GDPGrowth. For example, IRF_GDP[21]=-0.025 implies that the influence comes from one unit shock to the error in the TSpread will cause 20 step-ahead GDPGrowth decrease by 0.025. Note that a positive shock to Term spread has an immediate negative impact on GDP growth, with growth falling to -0.432. By about the 5qtr growth turns positive again and by the 20th quarter the impact of the shock is largely dissipated.  


# Consider the response of term spread to GDP growth shock
IRF_TSpread <- irf(VAR_fit, impulse="GDPGrowth", response="TSpread", n.ahead = 20, boot = TRUE)
plot(IRF_TSpread, ylab = "Term spread", main = "Shock from GDP growth")
