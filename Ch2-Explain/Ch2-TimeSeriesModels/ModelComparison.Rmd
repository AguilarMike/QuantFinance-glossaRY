GDP <- Quandl("FRED/GDPC1", type="xts",start_date=startd, end_date=endd)
GDPGrowth <- diff(log(GDP)) # calculate log growth rate
GDPGrowth <- na.omit(GDPGrowth) # get rid of the NAs
```

```{r}
library(forecast)
Model1<-Arima(GDPGrowth, order = c(1, 0, 0)) # fit an AR(1) model 
Model1

Model2<-Arima(GDPGrowth, order = c(0, 0, 3)) # fit an MA(3) model 
Model2
```
Notice that the AIC of Model2 is -844.78, which is smaller than then Model1's AIC -845.54, Model2 is better or with higher predict accuracy than Model1.
