# QuantFinance-glossaRy

## Overview
This project is designed to provide a quick reference for students and practitioners of quantitative finance. 
The project was started in the spring of 2022 while Prof. Aguilar was teaching a course titled Quantitative Methods in Finance at Kenan Flagler's day time MBA program. 
The material is organized by the workflow of a typical empirical project in quantitative finance: 1) Explore, 2) Explain, 3) Predict, 4) Protect
